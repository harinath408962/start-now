# Start Now

**Start Now** is a procrastination-aware learning assistant designed for students aged 18–24.

Unlike traditional task managers or productivity tools, this platform focuses on the **psychological barrier of starting tasks**, not just planning them.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many students fail to study or build skills not because of lack of resources, but because of:
- procrastination
- distractions
- lack of consistency
- fear of starting large tasks

Most tools focus on *what to do*.  
**Start Now focuses on helping users actually begin.**
